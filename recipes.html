            </div>

            <p>Nem nướng is a Vietnamese grilled sausage. Nem nướng cuốn is a specific spring roll that incorporates nem nướng. It is a popular street food in Vietnam and it originated from my parent's hometown: Nha Trang, Vietnam. The spring roll is made with rice paper, lettuce, mint, and nem nướng. It is served with a dipping sauce that is made with fish sauce, sugar, water, and lime juice. The following recipe from <a href="https://takestwoeggs.com/nem-nuong-cuon/">Takes Two Eggs</a>.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <div class="recipe-desc">
            <h4>Nem nướng</h4>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>4 lb Pork Shoulder butcher ground 2x</li>
                <li>4 tablespoon ice water</li>
                <li>4 tablespoon fish sauce</li>

                <li>20 Garlic cloves pulverized</li>
                <li>3 tablespoon roasted rice flour bot thinh</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Wonton crisp</h4>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>15 Wonton wrappers</li>
                <li>15 stalks green onion</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons Vegetable oil</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>To serve</h4>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>Lettuce</li>
                <li>Mint</li>
                <li>Vietnamese Coriander Rau Ram</li>
                <li>Vietnamese Perilla Tia To</li>
                <li>Cucumber</li>
                <li>Vermicelli Noodles optional</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Garlic fish sauce dip</h4>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>½ cup Fish sauce</li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>½ cup + 2 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
                <li>½ cup lemon or lime juice</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves minced</li>
                <li>Garlic chili paste to taste</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <!-- <h4>Make the Nem Nướng</h4> -->
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, mix together 4 tbsp of ice water, 4 tbsp of fish sauce, and 2 ½ tsp baking powder. Add in the ground pork and mix with your hand thoroughly. Place in a large ziplock bag and marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
                <li>Grind the garlic in the food processor until it turns into a paste. Take the garlic out and put it in a separate bowl. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Fill 1/3 of the food processor with the marinated pork and the pork for 30 seconds until the meat turns into a paste. Remove the meat and continue with the remaining marinated meat until completed.</li>
                <li>Gradually mix the garlic and the rice flour with the meat in three different portions. This helps you thoroughly mix in the garlic and the rice flour since the meat will be sticky. Continue mixing until combined.</li>
                <li>Place about 2 feet sheet of plastic wrap on your work surface. Place one end of the plastic wrap on a kitchen scale. Measure about 0.75 lb of meat on the scale. Then tightly roll the meat in a roll try removing all the air bubbles. When rolling, make sure to leave the two ends of the plastic to wrap like a giant candy. You will need the ends to tighten the meat into a log. Then, twist the ends as tightly as you possibly can, then tie the ends with string or a rubber band, and marinate for at least 5 hours or overnight. The tighter you roll and twist the ends the tighter the meat will hold together and be easier for shaping.</li>
                <li>Smash the meat down to the size of a circle that is 1/2 inch thick and about 5-6 inches in diameter. Cover with a damp paper towel, and microwave on each side for 1 minute this will hold the meat together when pan-frying it. On a medium-large skillet, add olive oil and heat to medium-high. Place the meat on the pan and cook for 1 minute on each side or until slightly charred. Vertically, slice the meat into 1 cm slices.</li>
                <li>Wrap each wonton wrapper with a stalk of green onion and then seal with vegetable oil. Cook in the air fryer at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. Alternatively, you can heat your skillet on high, fill the bottom of your skillet with vegetable oil, and when the oil reaches 350-365 F fry the wonton wrappers until brown and crispy about 3-4 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the fish sauce, minced garlic, lemon juice, sugar, and garlic chili paste.</li>
            </ol>

            </div>

            <p>Bánh xèo is sometimes referred to as a Vietnamese savoury crepe. It is made with rice flour, coconut milk, and turmeric. It is filled with pork, shrimp, and bean sprouts. It is served with lettuce, mint, and a dipping sauce that is made with fish sauce, sugar, water, and lime juice. It's super crispy and comforting to each on rainy days.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <div class="recipe-desc">
            <h4>Batter</h4>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>127.5 g rice flour</li>

                <li>0.5 medium yellow onion</li>
                <li>7 fl oz coconut cream</li>
                <li>0.75 lb bean sprouts</li>
                <li>0.25 dry mung beans</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Vegetables</h4>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>0.5 head mustard greens caỉ xanh
                </li>
                <li>0.5 bunch mint</li>
                <li>0.5 medium yellow onion</li>
                <li>0.5 bunch cilantro</li>
                <li>0.5 bunch Vietnamese perilla</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Combine all batter ingredients except scallions in a large bowl for at least 3 hours, or overnight. Add scallions only right before making the crêpes.
                </li>
                <li>Steam or soak mung beans in water until soft.
                </li>
                <li>Boil pork until cooked through and soft, then slice thinly.
                </li>
                <li>Remove shrimp heads and devein shrimp if desired.
                </li>
                <li>Wash bean sprouts and veggies.
                </li>
                <li>On medium-high heat add 1-2 teaspoons of oil and some onions
                </li>
                <li>Immediately add a few pieces of pork and shrimp. Sauté, lightly mixing until very lightly browned and fragrant.
                </li>
                <li>Pour in some batter and quickly tilt & rotate the pan so the batter is evenly spread. Add more batter if it wasn't enough to cover the pan. There should only be a thin layer of batter that almost flakes off at the pan edges where it's thinner. If your batter doesn't do that and is too thick, add a few tbsp water to the batter and mix to thin it out.
                </li>
                <li>Lower the heat to medium. Add some mung beans, bean sprouts, and cover with a lid for about 3 minutes, or until bean sprouts are slightly cooked. The batter should also be slightly cooked and transparent around the edges. This step cooks the top side of the ingredients and batter while it steams since we won't be flipping the crepe.
                </li>
                <li>Remove the lid, lower heat to medium-low and wait for the crêpe to become crisp. This takes about 5-7 minutes. This step lets the ingredients fully cook through, including the batter. It also lets steam escape so the batter can crisp up. Brush on a little oil around the edges if you're not seeing or hearing enough batter to pan contact. Fold in half, transfer to a plate and serve immediately. For batter troubleshooting please see the troubleshooting section in the post above.
                </li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Cook noodles according to package instructions, split between 4-5 bowls
                </li>
                <li>Thinly slice shallots, add oil to a pan and saute until light brown.
                </li>
                <li>Add quartered tomatoes, stir fry for 3-5 minutes until slightly soft.
                </li>
                <li>Add shallots, tomatoes, and all remaining soup ingredients into a large pot.
                </li>
                <li>Raise to high heat until it hits a boil, and boils for five minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low or low, so it maintains a low boil while you work on the Riêu.
                </li>
                <li>Add shallots into a small food processor, pulse until finely chopped.
                </li>
                <li>Add shrimp, pulse 5-6 times.
                </li>
                <li>Add remaining ingredients (except crab and green onion) and pulse a few times until evenly mixed.
                </li>
                <li>Pour into a mixing bowl, add crab and lightly mix with a spoon.
                </li>
                <li>Using a soup spoon, scoop 1-2 tbsp size meat balls (your choice!) into the pot until you use it all
                </li>
                <li>Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil, then drop heat to a low boil. At most it should take 20 minutes to cook the meatballs all the way through. Check doneness by breaking a meatball in half to make sure its not soft or raw inside.
                </li>
                <li>During the last five minutes of cooking, drop in the chopped green onion so it slightly softens

            <p>Ốc len xào dừa is a dish that is made with snails and coconut milk. It is a popular Vietnamese street food. Since the snails are small, you eat it by sucking the snails out of its shell.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <div class="recipe-desc">

            <h4>Ốc</h4>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>1 lb cone-shaped escargot/mud creepers
                </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable/coconut oil
                </li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic
                </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons minced lemongrass (the tender stalk of about 2 fresh lemongrass stalks)
                </li>
                <li>1 14-oz can coconut milk
                </li>
                <li>1/3 cup water
                </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt
                </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sugar
                </li>
                <li>Vietnamese coriander (optional)
                </li>
                <li>Red chili peppers (optional)
                </li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>If using fresh snails, soak them in water with a little bit of salt for at least 30 minutes to purge the grit and sand. Carefully hack off the coned end of each snail to loosen up the suction. Then thoroughly rinse and drain dry. If using frozen sea snails, the ends usually are already cut.
                </li>
                <li>In a medium-sized pan, heat vegetable oil on medium high. Add garlic, lemongrass and chili peppers (optional). If you are using fresh lemongrass, instead of tossing the tough leafy parts, cut them up into 2-inch segments and toss into the pan as well. Saute in oil until fragrant (about 15 seconds) then immediately add snails. Toss in the aromatics for about one minute.
                </li>
                <li>Add coconut milk and water. Simmer on low for 5-7 minutes. Season with salt and sugar to taste.
                </li>
                <li>Garnish with fresh Vietnamese coriander leaves (optional).
                </li>
            </ol>

                <li>Marinate the prawns with the garlic, spring onion heads, chicken bouillon powder, salt, fish sauce and pepper for a minimum of 20 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Blend the rice and coconut milk in a blender until it has become a puree.
                </li>
                <li>Mix the Bánh Khọt flour mix with the water, coconut milk and rice blend, soda water or beer, cooking oil and salt until well combined.

                <li>Use a sieve to strain the mixture into a bowl and remove any lumps.
                </li>
                <li>Set up your Bánh Khọt pan on high heat. When hot, pour 3 tbsp oil in each hole. It's a lot of oil, but that will help it get extra crispy.

                <li>Take the mini savory pancakes out when they have become crispy on the edges and place on a plate lined with paper towels.
                </li>
                <li>In a small saucepan, heat up the coconut milk and stir in the salt and tapioca starch until it has slightly thickened.
                </li>
                <li>Pour it in each of the pancakes and serve fresh with Vietnamese herbs, lettuce, spring onion oil, pickled carrots and daikon and a dipping sauce!
